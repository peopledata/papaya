- Publish and share data assets into Data Market;

## How to Use
User request his papaya app from [peopledata](https://www.peopledata.org.cn/zh/datamarket) or metachain `genesis member`.

After request is approved, user will receive an email, which include a `url` and `access token`. By click the `url`, a new papaya app will be generated on behalf of user. User's papaya app is hosted by itself, that is to say, there is no 3rd party between user and papaya app.

User could use any web browser to use his papaya app. For security and privacy concerns, each papaya app has one and only one user.
